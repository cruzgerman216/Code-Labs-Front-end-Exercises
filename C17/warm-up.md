# Warm Up Exercise


## Exercise 1 
Given two strings, return true if they are anagrams of one another.

An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.

If both strings are anagrams of each other than return true otherwise return false. 

```js

function isAnagram(first, second){

}

isAnagram("cinema", "iceman"); // true 
isAnagram("organge", "yellow"); //false
```


## Exercise 2
Given two strings. One string representing a name. The second string representing a sentence. 

Return the count of how many times the name appears in the sentence. 

```js

nameCount(name, sentence){

}

let person = "John";
let announcement = "Congratulations John! John is a yoga master since the beginning of next week. A lot of last week began when John was only a banana. Trees from nectarines became apparent when he began mastering the weather"

nameCount(person, sentence); // 3
```
