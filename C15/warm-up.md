# Warm Up Exercise


Given the empty array.

```js
let numbers = [];
```

- Push numbers 0 - 50 into this array. Use the push method to do this. 
  - Hint. Using a loop will be a good use case in this scenario. 

Use the built in array method filter to filter out even numbers of the array. 

From there, add each and every number from the array.
