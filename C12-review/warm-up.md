# Warm Up Exercise


# Exercise 1
Given the variable.

```js
let name = "Amy";
```

Define a function called updateNames with one parameter. This function will replace the name John with the given parameter.
```js

function updateNames(name) {
  let sentence = "Hello, my name is John. My friend's name is also John.";
  // Build your logic here
}

updateNames(name); // "Hello, my name is Amy. My friend's name is also Amy."
```


# Exercise 2
Given the string
```js
let sentence = "My name is John!";
```

Define a function called reverse with one parameter. This function will reverse the string. You cannot use any built in methods to do this. Use a loop.

```js
function reverse(str) {
  // Build your logic here
}

reverse(sentence); // "!nhoJ si eman yM"
```
